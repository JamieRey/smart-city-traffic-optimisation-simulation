To force the SPCs to drive 2 abrest, I changed the vClass of the 
vehicles to inherit there overtaking abilities.

After changing the vClass I had to activate the "sublane-model" option 
within the .sumocfg file.

To add a nice touch to the simulator, so that the motorbikes looked less 
like motorbikes, and ended up looking more like the SPCs,I altered the 
vType attribute guiShape to "evehicle".
