CREATING A NETWORK

--

How to generate grid networks with NETGENERATE.

--

Type "netgenerate -g" into terminal to specify a grid network.

--grid.number specifies the number of junctions

--default.lanenumber 2 specifies the number of lanes on each edge

After use the following options to customise

CREATING THE VEHICLE ROUTES (.trips.xml)

--

Ease method of populating the network with vehicles

	- Run $SUMO_HOME/tools/randomTrips.py
	
	- Here's the command options

		- -n "networkToBePopulated"

		- -o "nameOfOutputXmlFile.trip.xml"

		- -b begining trip time

		- -e end trip time

		- -p trip repetition rate

--

After generating the .trips.xml file, you must use the DUAROUTER tool to 
generate the routes file (.rou.xml)

--

To generate the route files,  

	- run duarouter

		- note: must be in the simulations directory

	- Here's the options

		- --trip-file "tripsXmlFile.trips.xml"

		- --net-file "networkFile.net.xml"

		- --output-file "nameOfOutputFile.rou.xml"

--

CREATING A CONFIGURATION FILE

--

A configuration file is a simple way of minimising the amount of command 
line commands that you need to type in.

The template which can be generated is too complicated for what we're 
doing, so I recomend writing your own configuration file.

You must at least specify:

	- The .net.xml file

	- The .rou.xml file

Optionally, you can specify:

	- .setting.xml
